I'm currently a graduate student at Heidelberg University, and also affiliated with Max Planck Institute for Astronomy. I currently work in MPIA Data Science group, and my current research focuses on observational galaxy evolution at high redshift and machine learning applications in astronomy, in particular with imaging and spectroscopic data from JWST and HST.
